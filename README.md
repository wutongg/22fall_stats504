This is the repository for UM STATS 504 capstone projects:

1. Using GLMs to [analyze the price of laptops from eBay][1]
  * Our client didn't have any quantitative background and is a visual person.
  * Preferred a laptop with a SSD and a large amount of storage space from the BIN listing.
  * Gave recommendations for good deals.
  
2. [Analysis on Diabetic Retinopathy][2]
  * Our client was an ophthalmologist at Michigan medicine.
  * Determined and qualified the efficacy of treatment type on visual acuity.
  * The main methodology is Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimator and Cox Proportional Hazard (Cox PH) model for survival analysis.
  
3. [Analysis on What Makes a Kickstarter Campaign Successful][3]
  * Our client was starting a new community-based business in Detroit and they were considering using Kickstarter for start-up funding.
  * Determined the factors that lead to a successful campaign in the US.
  * Predicted whether our clients could get funds if they used Kickstarter.
  * The main methodology is tree-based methods (decision tree & random forest). The baseline model is logistic regression model.
  
4. [Analysis on Predicting House Prices in New Taipei][4]
  * Our client was a lawyer from New Taipei City for a housing fraud case by comparing the estimated housing prices to the actual prices.
  * Built a prediction (regression) model to estimate the housing prices.
  * The main methodology is Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with smoothing splines.

5. Analysis on [nuMoM2b][5]
  * Focused on one of the adverse pregnancy outcomes, diabetes.
  * Developed binary classification models, which provided predictions on whether pregnant individuals would suffer from diabetes based on nuMoM2b dataset.
  * Used classification methods such as Logistic regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Adaptive Gradient Boosting.

6. [Analysis on Graduation Rates][6]
  * Our client was the director of admissions at Polytechnic Institute of Portalegre in Portugal.
  * Collected data related to student enrollment in undergraduate courses between 2008 to 2019.
  * Determined and quanlitied the causal effect of studentsâ€™ grades required for admissions on graduation.
  * Investigated student features and other external factors, such as age at enrollment and current inflation rates, that possibly contribute to varying admission grades.
